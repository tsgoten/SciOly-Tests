# SciOly Tests
Source code for the tests made for SBHS Science Olympiad.

Most of these are LaTeX files, be careful using git with these files since git is not designed to handle LaTeX files. There are also pdf documens as well as images, all part of the project. Keep each test in its own folder, and maintain that project to avoid conflicts.
