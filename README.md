# SciOly Tests
## Source code for the tests made for SBHS Science Olympiad.

Each test and all its assets should be in its own folder. 

# Setup
Most of these are LaTeX files, be careful using git with these files since git is not designed to handle LaTeX files. The source .tex file should be called `main.tex`

# Slack
Use the latex slack channel for help about LaTeX.
